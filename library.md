# 📚 Signal Library

> *“We are shaped by the systems we study, the frameworks we use, and the stories we return to.”*

The **Signal Library** is my curated canon of thinkers, frameworks, and references.  
It spans **enterprise architecture, product strategy, systems thinking, and civilizational imagination**.  

Not a blogroll — a foundation I return to when designing or scaling systems.
