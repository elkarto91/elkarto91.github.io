# 🧠 Signal Stack

> *“A portfolio of systems — real, independent, and enterprise-grade — where architecture meets execution.”*

The **Signal Stack** is my deep lab: a space for **enterprise case studies, independent platforms, and fictional prototypes**.  
Here, I document **lifecycles, architectural frameworks, and governance models** — blending **TOGAF, LeanIX, and product strategy** into practice.

## 🚀 Enterprise Case Studies

### 📑 EU VAT Compliance Engine  
A blockchain-powered VAT compliance system ensuring proof of delivery across EU borders.  

- **Architecture Lens (TOGAF/LeanIX)**  
  - Business: Compliance reporting, fraud reduction  
  - Application: ERP integration (mock SAP flows)  
  - Data: Delivery evidence, digital signatures  
  - Technology: Blockchain receipts, API gateway  

- **Outcome**  
  → Reduced VAT fraud by >80%  
  → Recognized at European Tax Summit

### 📡 Telecom Reconciliation Platform  
Settlement engine for roaming operators, processing billions of CDRs.  

#### TOGAF Lifecycle  

1. **Conceive**  
   - Problem: Months-long roaming settlement with high OPEX + disputes.  
   - Vision: Automate reconciliation via blockchain auditability + AI anomaly detection.  

2. **Plan**  
   - Stakeholders: Telcos, regulators, roaming teams  
   - LeanIX: Application portfolio — legacy mediation vs. reconciliation modules  
   - ArchiMate: Technology + Data flow diagrams  

3. **Develop**  
   - Stack: Hedera Hashgraph · Hyperledger Fabric · Python anomaly engine · Postgres  
   - Architecture: AI detects mismatches → blockchain logs receipts → smart contracts calculate settlements.  

4. **Qualify**  
   - KPIs: OPEX reduction %, dispute resolution time, % reconciled automatically  
   - OKR Example: “Reduce dispute resolution time from 60 days → <15 days by Q2.”  

5. **Launch**  
   - Piloted in multi-operator roaming environment  
   - Integrated via OSS/BSS APIs  

6. **Maximize**  
   - Added compliance dashboards for regulators  
   - LeanIX risk dashboards for blockchain upgrades + AI drift  

7. **Retire**  
   - Archive reconciliation history in distributed storage  
   - Regulator-facing lineage proofs  

#### Value  
- OPEX reduced ~60%  
- Dispute cycles shortened by ~30%  
- Clear alignment with **TOGAF Technology & Data Architecture layers**  
- Demonstrates use of **LeanIX for portfolio & risk governance**

### 💱 Stablecoin Payment Platform  
Cross-border settlement rails using stablecoins.  

- Atomic swaps, liquidity pools, compliance modules  
- Outcome: Piloted with regulated institutions; counterparty risk eliminated  

---

### 🌍 Renewable Energy Infrastructure (REI)  
Traceability for renewable energy certificates.  

- IoT + blockchain for carbon credit validation  
- Outcome: Regulators + buyers gain verifiable provenance

## 🌱 Independent Platforms

These projects represent my **personal exploration of system design, governance, and scale**.  

### 🔐 Neuralic – AI Governance & Explainability  

#### TOGAF Lifecycle  

1. **Conceive**  
   - Problem: AI adoption lacks audit trails + explainability  
   - Vision: Governance stack that makes AI traceable, explainable, regulator-ready  

2. **Plan**  
   - Stakeholders: CIOs, compliance officers, AI leads  
   - LeanIX: Map AI services across portfolios  
   - ArchiMate: Business → Application → Data flows  

3. **Develop**  
   - Stack: Modular services (Neuralic.Core, Neuralic.Trace, Neuralic.Engine)  
   - Architecture: Policy store, lineage tracker, explainability layer  
   - Security: RBAC, encrypted audit logs, zero-trust APIs  

4. **Qualify**  
   - KPIs: % of decisions logged, % explainable models, compliance coverage  
   - OKR Example: “Achieve 100% AI lineage tracking across enterprise ML pipelines by Q4.”  

5. **Launch**  
   - MVP open-sourced under *SignalBuilds*  
   - Policy templates + governance docs published  

6. **Maximize**  
   - Cloud integrations (Azure OpenAI, AWS Sagemaker)  
   - LeanIX dashboards for model drift + risk mapping  

7. **Retire**  
   - Archive explainability logs  
   - Generate governance playbooks for successor AI systems  

#### Value  
- AI treated as **auditable infrastructure**  
- Bridges **TOGAF IS Architecture** with **LeanIX governance**  
- Independent flagship initiative demonstrating **trust-first design**
