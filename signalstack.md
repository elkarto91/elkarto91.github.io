# 🧠 Signal Stack

> Where systems are imagined and built.  
> Part playground, part lab — this is where I test product principles, ethical frameworks, and architectural clarity across both speculative and shipped systems.

## 🏗️ System Blueprints

> *Not every system exists. But the ones that should, deserve real design.*

Fictional but feasible — these are fully mapped product ideas exploring unbuilt possibilities. Each one is built with real-world thinking: from lifecycle to dilemmas.

### 🧭 **ChronoLedger**  
A programmable ledger for *time-based trust* — where value unlocks or decays based on verified timelines.

**Use Cases:**
- Energy credits that expire  
- Grief grants that fade gradually  
- Probation periods on social platforms  
- Amnesty zones in civic governance

**Lifecycle Summary:**  
- **Stack:** Solidity + Hedera  
- **GTM:** ESG dashboards + municipal partners  
- **Frameworks:** RACI, PRD, EOL  
- **Challenge:** Oracles, TTL misalignment

## 🪙 Operary

> *A minimal trust layer for verifiable work.*

**Problem:** Most small online work is unverifiable, invisible, or untracked.  
**Solution:** Operary is an open API + UI for programmable task assignments and immutable proof-of-work receipts.

**Stack:** Go, Postgres, Hedera, Cloudflare Workers  
**Launch:** Live at [operary.systemsignal.dev](https://operary.systemsignal.dev)

## 🔍 Real Projects

Built with full-stack thinking — concept to commit. These aren’t just ideas. They’re functional, deployed systems where I led product design, wrote core specs, and helped ship code.

### 🪙 [Operary](https://github.com/elkarto91/operary)  
A minimal, public API to create, track, and verify task-based work on-chain.  
→ **Focus**: Web3 design, verifiable work primitives, clean audit trails.  
→ **Stack**: Go, Hedera, Postgres, Cloudflare Workers  
→ **Unique Edge**: Thoughtfully small surface area with maximal trust utility

## 🛠️ ChronoLedger Lifecycle

### 1. Conceive  
- Problem: Value decays invisibly.  
- Idea: Make time programmable into trust systems.

### 2. Plan  
- Persona: Civic designers, ESG teams  
- Model: Protocol fees + TTL unlock tax

### 3. Develop  
- Stack: Solidity + Hedera  
- Infra: Schema versioning, contract testbed

### 4. Qualify  
- Metrics: Trust decayed, TTL precision  
- Risks: Oracles, misuse of time logic

### 5. Launch  
- Pilot: 30-day carbon amnesty citywide  
- GTM: Smart city dashboards

### 6. Maximize  
- Integrate into contracts, alerts, UIs  
- Timeline UX + countdowns

### 7. Retire  
- Archive TTL-ledger  
- Generate decay metrics + audit
