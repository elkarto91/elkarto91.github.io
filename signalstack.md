# üß† Signal Stack

> Where systems are imagined and built.  
> Part playground, part lab ‚Äî this is where I test product principles, ethical frameworks, and architectural clarity across both speculative and shipped systems.

## üèóÔ∏è System Blueprints

> *Not every system exists. But the ones that should, deserve real design.*

Fictional but feasible ‚Äî these are fully mapped product ideas exploring unbuilt possibilities. Each one is built with real-world thinking: from lifecycle to dilemmas.

### ü™ô Operary

> *A minimal trust layer for verifiable work.*

**Problem:** Most small online work is unverifiable, invisible, or untracked.  
**Solution:** Operary is an open API + UI for programmable task assignments and immutable proof-of-work receipts.

**Stack:** Go, Postgres, Hedera, Cloudflare Workers  
**Launch:** Live at [operary.systemsignal.dev](https://operary.systemsignal.dev)
