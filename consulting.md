# 🧠 Strategy & Product Consulting

> “The role of a strategist is not just to plan. It’s to clarify the system.”

I help product leaders, founders, and architects rethink their systems — technically, ethically, and strategically.

## 🔧 What I Offer

### 📌 1. Product Deep Dive (60 min)
Explore your product, roadmap, metrics, and architecture.  
→ Actionable clarity, friction points, and strategy decisions.

### 🧠 2. Systems Design Advisory (90 min)
Discuss complex product flows: traceability, zero trust, AI+blockchain infra.  
→ Best for platforms, protocols, civic design.

### 🕊️ 3. Quiet Problem Space (30 min)
Talk through an idea, doubt, or direction that needs framing, not pitching.  
→ A safe space for thinkers and builders.
