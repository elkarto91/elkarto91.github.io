## 🚀 How It Works

This site is built on:
- **Jekyll**: Static site generator used by GitHub Pages
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts and serves the site at your GitHub username domain
- **Minimal Theme**: A clean, content-focused theme with built-in responsiveness

### To Customize:

1. Edit `_config.yml` to update site title, description, and links
2. Modify `index.md` to update home page content
3. Optionally add blog posts to the `_posts/` folder
