## 🌌 Who I Am

I'm a product leader obsessed with building purposeful, scalable systems at the intersection of technology, trust, and human context.

- 10+ years across deep tech, enterprise platforms, and zero-trust architecture  
- Delivered blockchain-first systems for telecom, tax, and sustainability  
- Exploring how LLMs, traceability, and system incentives change product design

---

## 🧭 My Product Philosophy

> “Systems are shaped by incentives. Product managers are architects of those systems.”

- Zero-trust doesn’t just apply to code — it applies to teams  
- A good PRD reads like a blueprint *and* a manifesto  
- Scale is meaningless without clarity and closure  
- Product success = narrative clarity × system resilience
