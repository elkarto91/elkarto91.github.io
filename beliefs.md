# ðŸ§  What I Believe About Product

1. **Product is narrative + system + empathy**
2. **Trust is a design principle, not a feature**
3. **Simplicity isnâ€™t reduction â€” itâ€™s resolution**
4. **Teams are systems. Treat them like design problems**
5. **Vision without proof is noise. Proof without vision is inertia**
